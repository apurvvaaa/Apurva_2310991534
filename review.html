    <b>Lessons learned after reading this book are priceless. You get to know alot of true facts on financial aspects related to savings, investment,forecasts.. etc as well as on our psychological aspects on spending our money. I'm sure after learning this book and following as mentioned in the book ((i.e) saving more and finding our best investment plan rather than just going with the trend or copying others investment style without knowing their intentions and not knowing them personally too) can help us become financially independent and wealthy (not rich, but wealthy) which is everyone's end goal.</b>

    <b>Kanan Gill’s debut novel is a great foray into the science fiction genre, with heaps of the characteristic dry humour thrown in. While going through the pages, you can get into an impulsive comparison with the other great works of the genre, which is fine as long as you cut the author some slack for his first attempt. There definitely are parallels between Acts of Gods and Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency; but this novel is more an inspiration than a blatant rip-off.</b>
